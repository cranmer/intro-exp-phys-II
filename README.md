# Intro to Exp Phys II

* Kyle Cranmer 


This is a GitHub repository to accompany Intro to Exp Phys II. Click on the notebooks.
Sometimes the math in the notebooks doesn't display well in GitHub... and it doesn't work on many mobile phones.
Instead you can look at it with [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/). Here are some links for convenience:
   * [lecture 1](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/cranmer/intro-exp-phys-II/blob/master/lecture1-in-class-demo.ipynb)
   * [error propagation](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/cranmer/intro-exp-phys-II/blob/master/investigating%20propagation%20of%20errors%20-%20Interactive%20version.ipynb)
   * [change of variables](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/cranmer/intro-exp-phys-II/blob/master/change-of-variables.ipynb)


Run the notebooks from within your browser without installing anything thanks to [Binder](http://mybinder.org)
